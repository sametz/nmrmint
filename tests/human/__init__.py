"""Tests intended to be run manually with human interaction.

Testing any functionality requiring the Tk.mainloop running is apparently
very difficult. Until such a time that true functional testing of the entire
app can be worked out, useful human-run tests are included here.

Current modules:
    * toolbar_focus.py: test to see that focus changes as expected (i.e.
    to other entry-like widgets, and not others such as buttons.)
