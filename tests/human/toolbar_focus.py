"""A human-run test to see if toolbars have correct widget traversal.

Currently only tests FirstOrderBar.
"""
# TODO: add other toolbars as well.

# Purpose: intent is an integration test for toolbars and widgets, to test the
# widget._find_next_entry method (and, at some future time, ._on_return,
# ._on_tab, ._refresh as well.) When a similar, automated test was attempted,
# 'assert current_entry is not next_entry' was always false, and the initial
# entry widget was returned. Hypothesis is that _find_next_entry requires
# .tk.focusNext() and that this in turn requires the mainloop.
