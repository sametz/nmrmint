Known Issues
============

* When flipping back and forth between subspectra, at some point updates to a pre-existing second-order subspectrum may no longer register. Also, a new second-order subspectrum created with the same toolbar (i.e. same number of nuclei) will have the last-used values entered rather than the defaults, and be unresponsive.
