This app froze without issues using PyInstaller's defaults on my Macbook Pro
development computer.

There were two problems freezing the PC version:

1. tornado needed to be installed (this may have been solved with a more
thorough requirements.txt). Apparently tornado is required by an unused
matplotlib backend.

2. The scipy DLLs could not be found. In https://github
.com/pyinstaller/pyinstaller/issues/3235, xibili's trick worked. Note: on the
Windows 10 development PC, pipenv was used, and the library could be found under
 c:\Users\<username>\.virtualenvs\<project>\Lib\site-packages\scipi\extra-dll

For debugging, the following arguments were used:
    -- debug
    -- console (not --windowed)

and the following was added above the 'a = Analysis(...)' part of the appname
.spec file:

    options = [('v', None, 'OPTION')]

The generated appname.exe file was run using a command line window (not
powershell). Between the python errormessages in the pipenv shell, and the error
 messages from running the .exe from the command line, the issues could be
 tracked down and solved.
