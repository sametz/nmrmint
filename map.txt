Route to refactoring data model

Reasons:
    - to have different line widths possible for different subspectra
    - allow the spectrometer frequency to be changed mid-simulation and have
    total spectrum accurately update
    - to allow different spectral windows, rather than default to -50 min/+50
    max


1. Add left/right limit entry boxes. Suggest hard-coding max range from -1 ppm
to +15 ppm. Then use matplotlib's set_xlim to implement these. Note: if set_xlim
(larger_number, smaller_number), x axis should be automatically flipped, and any
 manual axis flipping in code could be removed.

2. Change the linspace used for lineshape calcs so that it is always from 15 to
-1 ppm. How big of a performance hit will this be? Note: if this works, the x
linspace will be a constant.

3. Turn subspectra into objects. These should hold the toolbar numerical
entries, the linewidth, and possibly the lineshape y data.

4. Change the history and update functions to use subspectra objects. If
linshape is part of the object, can re-compute linshapes only as needed.

5. Have a change in spectrometer frequency re-compute and re-add all subspectra.

6. Moving backwards/forwards in history: also change and re-configure toolbars?

Alternatives:
4. In lieu of current total spectrum history, be able to flip between
subspectra, and toggle them active/inactive (add to/delete from total spectrum).
6. Advanced modification: have undo/redo for subspectra instead of spectrum.

4/14/2018: The program will become more simple if an adapter is created to be
the interface between view and controller. Toolbars can send and receive
parameters (dict, JSON, ...). Data sent by toolbar is converted into the type
needed by the model and then passed to controller. Data received by toolbar is
used to set it to another state, allowing possible undo/redo functionality or
toolbar switching.

4/15/2018 The Controller really is just an adapter, so this program was really
using Model-View-Adapter throughout, not MVC. At some point, Adapter can
probably be merged with Controller to cut out the middleman.
