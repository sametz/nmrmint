nmrmint (version 0.1 pre-alpha)
*******************************

**nmrmint** is currently wafer-thin, and not fit for human consumption.

Eventually, an app will emerge that will 'mint' an NMR spectrum from
user-provided chemical shifts and coupling constants, with the goal of
producing artificial NMR spectra for chemistry education.

I strongly believe that using actual experimental data for classes and exams
is to be preferred. However, sometimes it can be hard to find spectra of
sufficient quality for printing on exams. Or, you may have a system that
would be easily solved at higher field strength, but you can only find
spectra taken in lower fields where second-order effects make analysis more
difficult. In such cases, nmrmint will provide you that spectrum you need for
that quiz tomorrow.
