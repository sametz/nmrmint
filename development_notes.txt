If MVC is properly implemented, it should be relatively easy to swap out the
view for another, e.g. a Webpage view, or PyQt. Clear API design and separation
of concerns is key.

Logic in the View should be reduced to just that required for the View itself.
It should not require any knowledge of the Model or Controller beyond knowing
where to send a request and having the right API to handle a response.

Where does the History and/or Subspectrum objects belong? Currently they have
knowledge of view implementation (toolbars). What might this look like as a web
app? It doesn't have to have the same layout, buttons, etc. Does the Controller
"call the shots" and stipulate what form the View must take, or is the View
allowed to choose its archetecture and only send/receive data requests to the
Controller?

Does History even require knowledge of toolbars? It only needs their model,
vars_ data. The View could figure out from the data what toolbar is required.
Storing a toolbar reference in History/Subspectrum is convenient, but possibly
unneccessary entanglement of responsibilities.
